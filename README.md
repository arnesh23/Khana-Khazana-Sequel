# Khana-Khazana-Sequel

"Khana-Khazana-Sequel" is a Food logger application that uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and Sequelize. MVC Desing pattern
was implemented in this application. The Front End uses HTML/CSS/Handlebars with Node and MYSQL in the backend. This application
is rendered in the same format as Khana-Khazana but instead of using an ORM, Sequelize is used extensively.

The user can add a new Khana(Indian/Pakistani Food) and either Devour It! or Savor It! If the Khana is Devoured, it is appended
to the Devoured! side of the WebPage. If the Khana is Savored, it is deleted from "Devoured!" side of WebPage and the database. Click on the Picture below to watch the application being run on localhost machine.
